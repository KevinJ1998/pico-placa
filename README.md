#About this App

This App was created using the React library and ant design for the styles of the components.

#How does it work? 

This application is focused on verify the license plate of the vehicles and check if it can be on the road or not, according to the Pico-Placa regime that is running in Quito, Ecuador. 
So, there is two ways that you can do that. One way is that you can enter a license plate and check if the vehicle with that license plate can be on the road today, and the other way is if you enter a license plate along with a date and a time, and check if that vehicle with that license plate can be on the road given the previus information. The application will return a pop up message wether you can or cannot be on the road.

#How do I have to type the info?

Simple, you have to write a valid license plate, for example POI-475. Rebemeber that a license plate begin with tree letters along with minus symbol and then tree or four numbers, if you don't write it like this the app will show you a pop up message telling you to write a valid license plate. For the date input, you must follow the correct format that is shown to you in the placeholder (mm/dd/aaaa).

#How can I try this app? 

If you want, you can clone this repo and follow the steps below to try it local, but if you don't want to clone and do all the process, you can go to this [link](https://pico-placa-virid.vercel.app/).

Also this app have testing scripts with cypress, so you can test it by running the following command ### `yarn run cypress open`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
